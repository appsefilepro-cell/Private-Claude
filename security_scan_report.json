    "1. Always validate and sanitize file paths before use",
    "2. Use os.path.abspath() and os.path.realpath() to resolve paths",
    "3. Implement allowlist-based path validation",
    "4. Never concatenate user input directly into file paths",
    "5. Use secure_filename() for user-provided filenames",
    "6. Restrict file operations to specific directories",
    "7. Implement proper error handling for file operations",
    "8. Use Path.resolve() for modern Python path handling"
