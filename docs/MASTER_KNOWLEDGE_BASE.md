- **Authoritative**: Demonstrate mastery of law with extensive citations

**Narrative Structure:**
1. **Opening Hook**: Powerful statement about injustice

6. **The Law**: Clear legal pathway to victory
7. **The Ask**: Specific, justified relief requested
8. **The Closure**: Vision of justice restored

- Use active voice (not passive)
- Short, powerful sentences for emphasis
- Varied sentence structure (rhythm)
- Concrete details (not abstract)
- Vivid verbs (not weak verbs)
- Minimal legalese (plain English preferred)
- Strategic repetition for key themes

**Example Opening:**
> "Thurman Malik Robinson stood on the sidewalk, watching movers haul his life's possessions onto the curb. He was 67 years old. A decorated veteran. A devoted father. And on this day in March 2023, he became homeless—not because he failed to pay rent, but because a property management company chose profit over the law, greed over humanity, and convenience over an elderly man's constitutional rights."
