<p><strong>HARDSHIP LETTER - REQUEST FOR PAYMENT PLAN</strong><br>
Rental Account: 15455 Point Northwest Blvd. W. 1410, Houston, Texas</p>

<p>To: Circle Park / EWC, LLC<br>
Attn: Slydell Moore, Property Manager<br>
Phone: 281-550-0004<br>
Re: Immediate Payment Plan Request to Prevent Eviction</p>

<p>Dear Ms. Moore,</p>

<p>I am writing to request an emergency payment plan to resolve my current rental balance of $1,930 due December 29, 2025 and prevent pending eviction.</p>

<p><strong>CURRENT SITUATION:</strong></p>

<p>I am experiencing extreme financial hardship due to multiple circumstances beyond my control:</p>

<p>1. Death of my father (Thurman Robinson Sr.) in California, requiring urgent estate settlement<br>
2. Criminal charges that were subsequently DISMISSED, but caused loss of employment<br>
3. Illegal eviction from previous residence (6301 Pale Sage Dr) where Sheriff unlawfully removed my belongings<br>
4. Medical disability affecting my ability to maintain consistent employment<br>
5. Pending lawsuit settlements that will provide funds but are not yet resolved</p>

<p><strong>EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME:</strong></p>

<p>I am a licensed tax professional and will resume full-time work on January 2, 2026 (first day of tax season). My income during tax season is substantial and reliable. I have been in the tax preparation business for over 14 years.</p>

<p><strong>PAYMENT PLAN PROPOSAL:</strong></p>

<p>I respectfully request the following payment arrangement:</p>

<p>- January 2, 2026: $500 (first day of tax season income)<br>
- January 15, 2026: $500<br>
- February 1, 2026: $500<br>
- February 15, 2026: $430 (plus current month rent of $1,930)<br>
- Continuing monthly rent payments on time thereafter</p>

<p><strong>RENTAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATIONS IN PROCESS:</strong></p>

<p>I am actively applying for rental assistance through:<br>
- Catholic Charities Houston<br>
- United Way 211 Texas<br>
- Harris County Community Services Department<br>
- Texas Rent Relief Program<br>
- LGBTQ-specific assistance programs (Montrose Center)</p>

<p>These applications typically pay landlords directly within 30-60 days.</p>

<p><strong>COMMITMENT TO RESOLVE:</strong></p>

<p>I am committed to maintaining this property as my home. I have never intentionally defaulted on rent. The circumstances causing this hardship are temporary and will be resolved through:</p>

<p>1. Tax season income starting January 2, 2026<br>
2. Pending rental assistance approvals<br>
3. Settlement funds from ongoing litigation<br>
4. Published book royalties ("From Foster Care to Financial Freedom" - available on Amazon/Apple Books)</p>

<p><strong>LEGAL PROTECTIONS APPLICABLE:</strong></p>

<p>Under the Fair Housing Act and ADA, I respectfully request reasonable accommodation due to my disability status. Additionally, as an LGBTQ individual who has faced discrimination and harassment, I am protected under federal and state anti-discrimination laws.</p>

<p><strong>IMMEDIATE ACTION:</strong></p>

<p>I will provide proof of the following within 48 hours:<br>
- Tax preparation license (PTIN)<br>
- Upcoming employment verification<br>
- Rental assistance application confirmations<br>
- Medical disability documentation<br>
- Police report regarding illegal eviction from previous residence</p>

<p><strong>APPEAL TO HUMANITY:</strong></p>

<p>I am asking for a chance to make this right. I have been a resident at this property and simply need time to recover from circumstances that would devastate anyone. Eviction during the holidays, while dealing with my father's death and disability, would cause irreparable harm.</p>

<p>I am available to discuss this payment plan immediately. Please contact me at:<br>
Email: terobinsony@gmail.com<br>
Phone: [Insert your phone number]</p>

<p>I respectfully request that you halt eviction proceedings while we finalize this payment arrangement.</p>

<p>Thank you for your consideration during this difficult time.</p>
