# FIX REPLIT DUPLICATES & PAYMENT ISSUE

**Problem:** You duplicated Replit project twice and now it wants payment
**Solution:** Delete duplicates and use Railway instead (100% free)

---

## 🔧 OPTION 1: DELETE REPLIT DUPLICATES (2 minutes)

### **Step 1: Go to Replit Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://replit.com
2. Login with your account

### **Step 2: Find Duplicate Projects**
1. You should see 2-3 copies of "Private-Claude" or similar
2. Each duplicate uses storage and may trigger payment

### **Step 3: Delete Duplicates**
For each duplicate project:
1. Click the **"..."** menu (3 dots) on the project
2. Select **"Delete"**
3. Confirm deletion
4. Repeat for all duplicates

**Keep:** 0 projects (we're using Railway instead)
**Delete:** All Replit projects

## 🔧 OPTION 2: FIX REPLIT PAYMENT (if you want to keep Replit)

### **Why Replit Wants Payment:**
- Free tier: 1 always-on Repl
- You created 2+ duplicates → exceeds free tier
- Solution: Delete duplicates, keep only 1

### **Free Tier Limits:**
- ✅ 1 always-on Repl (FREE)
- ✅ Unlimited storage up to 500MB (FREE)
- ❌ Multiple always-on Repls (PAID - $7/month)

### **How to Stay Free:**
1. Delete all duplicates (keep only 1)
2. Make sure only 1 Repl is "always on"
3. Replit will stop asking for payment
