## IV. EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE RELIEF

## VII. PLAINTIFF'S RIGHT TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

### A. LEGAL STANDARD (Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 680)

To obtain a TRO, Plaintiff must show:
1. ✅ **Probable right to relief sought** (clear violation of § 92.008)
2. ✅ **Probable, imminent, and irreparable injury** (health risk from no water)
3. ✅ **No adequate remedy at law** (damages can't restore health/safety)
4. ✅ **Grossly inadequate legal remedy** (emergency requires immediate action)

### B. PLAINTIFF MEETS ALL REQUIREMENTS

**1. Probable Right to Relief:**
- Texas Property Code § 92.008 **explicitly prohibits** utility shutoffs as eviction tactics
- Defendants violated this statute by shutting off water
- Previous eviction case was **dismissed**, making this self-help eviction unlawful

**2. Probable, Imminent, and Irreparable Injury:**
- **Imminent:** Injury is occurring NOW - no water for _____ days
- **Irreparable:** Health consequences from dehydration and unsanitary conditions cannot be undone
- **Ongoing:** Harm continues every day water remains off

**3. No Adequate Remedy at Law:**
- Money damages cannot restore immediate health and safety
- Emergency requires immediate relief, not future compensation

**4. Grossly Inadequate Legal Remedy:**
- Even if Plaintiff wins damages later, permanent health damage may occur
- Waiting for trial would render the remedy meaningless
