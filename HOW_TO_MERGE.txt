SIMPLE 3-STEP PROCESS:
======================

STEP 1: Pull Latest Private-Claude
-----------------------------------
1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt
2. Navigate to Private-Claude:
   cd C:\Users\ladss\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Private-Claude

3. Pull latest changes:
   git pull origin claude/deploy-agent-x2-01826tc4741Zm819Gf6PaXAX


STEP 2: Run the Merge Script
-----------------------------
In the same PowerShell window:

   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File MERGE_REPOSITORIES.ps1

The script will:
✅ Check both repositories exist
✅ Add CLAUDE-CODE-AI as remote
✅ Merge automatically
✅ Resolve common conflicts (README, requirements.txt, .gitignore)
✅ Ask you to confirm before pushing
✅ Archive the old repository


STEP 3: Test Everything
------------------------
After merge completes:

   bash scripts/complete_agent30_setup.sh

This runs all tests and verifies everything works.


THAT'S IT!
==========
The script does everything automatically.
Just run it and answer the prompts.


WHAT IF IT FAILS?
==================
If merge fails for any reason:

1. Abort the merge:
   git merge --abort

2. Try manual copy instead (slower but safer):
   - Copy unique files from CLAUDE-CODE-AI to Private-Claude manually
   - git add .
   - git commit -m "Add files from CLAUDE-CODE-AI"
   - git push


SAFETY NOTES:
=============
✅ All changes in Private-Claude are already committed and pushed
✅ Script creates archive of old repo (not deleted)
✅ Can rollback with: git reset --hard af88db1
✅ Full backup recommended before merge


NEED HELP?
==========
If script doesn't work:
1. Open REPOSITORY_MERGE_GUIDE.md for detailed manual instructions
2. Or manually copy unique files from one repo to the other


STATUS: Ready to merge!
========================
All Private-Claude changes are committed and pushed.
Safe to proceed with merge.
