RE: Dispute of Unauthorized Account Closure
    Account: [Your BMO Account Number]
    Account Holder: Thurman Earl Robinson Jr. / Thurman Malik Robinson

Dear BMO Harris Bank,

I am writing to formally dispute the unauthorized closure of my account and to demand immediate investigation, restoration of my account, and compensation for damages incurred.

ACCOUNT INFORMATION:

Account Holder Name: Thurman Earl Robinson Jr. (Thurman Malik Robinson)
Account Number: [Your Account Number]
Account Type: [Checking/Savings]
Date Account Opened: [Date]
Date Account Closed: [Date account was closed]
Reason Given for Closure: [State reason given by BMO, if any]

UNAUTHORIZED CLOSURE - FACTS:

1. My account was closed without proper notice or explanation
2. I did not authorize or request account closure
3. I was not provided with required advance notice under federal banking regulations
4. Account closure caused severe financial hardship and damages
5. I have documentation and evidence (including 70,000+ images from iPhone) supporting my claims

VIOLATIONS OF BANKING REGULATIONS:

BMO's unauthorized closure of my account violates:

1. Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1831)
2. Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. § 1681) - if closure reported to ChexSystems
3. Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. § 1693) - if electronic transactions were affected
4. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) regulations
5. State consumer protection laws
6. BMO's own account agreement and terms of service
