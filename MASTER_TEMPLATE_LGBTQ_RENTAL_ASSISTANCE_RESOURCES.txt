CRITICAL TIPS FOR LGBTQ APPLICANTS

1. Disclose your LGBTQ status strategically:
- WITH LGBTQ-specific organizations (Montrose Center, Covenant House): YES - this can prioritize your application
- WITH general agencies: Only if asked or if relevant to discrimination/safety concerns

2. Document any discrimination:
- If landlord made anti-LGBTQ comments, write them down
- If you're facing housing discrimination, tell Lone Star Legal Aid immediately

3. Use chosen name:
- If documents show legal name but you use a different name, explain this to case managers
- Montrose Center can help with name/gender marker changes

4. Safety first:
- If apartment complex is unsafe for LGBTQ residents, mention this to case managers
- May qualify for emergency relocation assistance

-----

FINAL NOTES

About "6-Month Programs":
Most rental assistance programs do NOT pay for 6 months upfront. They typically provide:
- 1-3 months of back rent, OR
- 3-6 months of future rent in monthly installments, OR
- One-time emergency payment ($500-$2,000)

The closest to "6-month assistance" is:
- Section 8 vouchers (ongoing, but years-long waitlist)
- Montrose Center transitional housing (case-by-case)

Reality: You need to combine multiple small assistance sources to cover your gap. Example:
- $500 from Wesley Community Center
- $300 from Catholic Charities
- $400 from 211 referral agency
- Payment plan with apartment for remainder
