## 🧠 MACHINE LEARNING + QUANTUM PHYSICS

### Machine Learning (via Zapier + Airtable)

**How it works WITHOUT code:**
1. Every winning trade logged to Airtable
2. Airtable formulas calculate:
   - Success rate by pair
   - Success rate by time
   - Success rate by pattern
   - Average profit by strategy
3. Zapier detects patterns with >70% success rate
4. Sends insights to Slack #ai-communication
5. Strategy automatically adapts

**You don't write ML code - Zapier + Airtable do it!**

### Quantum Physics (via Zapier Parallel Paths)

**How it works WITHOUT code:**
1. Zapier workflow triggers every 15 minutes
2. Splits into 4 parallel paths:
   - Path A: MT5 Account 1 trade
   - Path B: MT5 Account 2 trade
   - Path C: MT5 Account 3 trade
   - Path D: OKX trade
3. All 4 execute simultaneously
4. Results aggregated
5. Summary sent to Slack

**Parallel execution WITHOUT custom code!**

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### OKX Live Account
- **This is REAL money**
- Start conservatively with $10-50 trades
- Test strategy on demos first
- Only scale up after consistent wins
- Set your API passphrase in: `OKX_TRADING_BOT_CONFIG.json`

### MetaTrader Demo Accounts
- **This is DEMO money** - risk-free testing
- Trade aggressively to gather data
- Test ALL pairs and patterns
- Learn what works, apply to OKX live later

### Zapier Task Limits
- Free tier: 100 tasks/month
- Each trade notification = 1 task
- With 350+ trades, you'll need Starter plan ($19.99/month for 750 tasks)
- Worth it to automate everything!

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Zapier workflows not triggering"
- Check all accounts are connected
- Verify webhooks are correct
- Ensure Zaps are turned ON
- Check task limit not exceeded

### "MT5 trades not showing in Google Sheets"
- Verify MT5 + Zapier integration (see GITHUB_COPILOT_MASTER_PROMPT.md Phase 2)
- Check MT5 Cloud is enabled
- Test webhook manually

### "OKX trades not executing"
- Verify API passphrase is set
- Check API permissions include "Trade"
- Ensure sufficient balance
- Test in demo mode first

### "GitHub Copilot not generating code"
- Verify Copilot is enabled in Cursor settings
- Check GitHub authentication: `gh auth status`
- Ensure you're using master prompt from GITHUB_COPILOT_MASTER_PROMPT.md
