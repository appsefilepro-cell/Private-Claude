IMPORTANT DEADLINES:

Appeals in eviction cases must be filed within a very short timeframe (typically 5 days from judgment). However, if you did not receive proper notice of the appeal deadline, you may file a Motion for Extension of Time or Motion for New Trial based on lack of notice.

If the appeal deadline has passed, you may need to file:
1. Motion for New Trial (citing lack of notice, procedural defects)
2. Bill of Review (equitable remedy for void or invalid judgments)
3. Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus (if eviction violated constitutional rights)

CONSULT AN ATTORNEY IMMEDIATELY to determine the best course of action for your specific situation and timeline.
