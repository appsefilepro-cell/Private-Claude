Dear Frontier Utilities,

I am writing to request an emergency payment plan to resolve my past-due balance and prevent service disconnection.

CURRENT BALANCE AND HARDSHIP:

I am experiencing extreme financial hardship due to:
- Death of my father requiring travel to California for estate matters
- Loss of employment due to circumstances now resolved (criminal charges DISMISSED)
- Medical disability affecting consistent income
- Pending rental assistance that will cover utility arrears

EMPLOYMENT RETURNING:

I am a licensed tax professional resuming full-time work January 2, 2026 (first day of tax season). My tax season income is substantial and will allow me to resolve this balance completely.

PAYMENT PLAN PROPOSAL:

I respectfully request the following arrangement:

- January 2, 2026: $100 (plus current month service)
- January 15, 2026: $100
- February 1, 2026: $100 (plus current month service)
- February 15, 2026: $100
- March 1, 2026: Remaining balance (plus current month service)

RENTAL ASSISTANCE IN PROCESS:

I have applied for utility assistance through:
- Catholic Charities Houston (utility bill payment program)
- United Way 211 Texas
- Harris County Community Services Department
- Texas Energy Assistance Program

These programs pay utility providers directly within 30-60 days.

UTILITY NECESSITY:

I require uninterrupted utility service due to:
1. Medical disability requiring climate-controlled environment
2. Home-based tax preparation business (starting January 2, 2026)
3. Caretaking responsibilities for disabled father's estate matters
4. Upcoming tax season requiring internet/electricity for client services

COMMITMENT:

I am committed to resolving this balance in full. This hardship is temporary. Disconnection would cause severe harm to my health, employment, and ability to resolve the debt.

IMMEDIATE CONTACT:

Please contact me to finalize this payment arrangement:
Email: terobinsony@gmail.com
Phone: [YOUR PHONE NUMBER]

I am available Monday-Friday 9am-5pm and can provide documentation within 48 hours.

Thank you for your understanding and flexibility during this difficult time.

Sincerely,

Thurman Earl Robinson Jr.
