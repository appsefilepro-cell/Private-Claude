RE: Request for Emergency Payment Plan Due to Financial Hardship

-----

Dear Property Management Team,

I am writing to formally request an emergency payment plan for my December 2025 rent obligation and anticipated January 2026 rent payment. I understand that my December rent remains unpaid, and I am reaching out proactively before receiving an eviction notice to demonstrate my commitment to resolving this matter and maintaining my tenancy.

CURRENT FINANCIAL HARDSHIP

I am currently experiencing severe financial hardship due to circumstances beyond my control. As a business owner and entrepreneur, my income streams have been significantly disrupted while simultaneously managing substantial personal and family responsibilities. I am the CEO of APPS HOLDINGS WY, INC., and Chief Financial Officer of Assertively Promoting Philanthropic Services APPS, LLC, and have been actively pursuing federal contracts and grant opportunities that will stabilize my financial situation in the coming months.

Additionally, I am managing complex legal matters across multiple jurisdictions that have required substantial time and resources, temporarily impacting my ability to maintain my previous income levels. These include probate proceedings related to my late father's estate in Los Angeles County and ongoing civil matters in Harris County that have consumed both financial resources and time that would otherwise be dedicated to income-generating activities.

MY COMMITMENT TO RESOLUTION

I am not requesting forgiveness of rent obligations. I am requesting a structured payment plan that will allow me to fulfill my lease obligations while maintaining stable housing. Stable housing is essential for me to continue pursuing the business contracts and legal resolutions that will restore my financial stability.

I am actively pursuing multiple forms of assistance, including:

- Emergency rental assistance programs through 211 Texas and local nonprofit organizations
- Utility assistance programs to address my overdue utility bills
- Federal grant applications for small business support
- Contract opportunities that are currently in final negotiation stages

PROPOSED PAYMENT PLAN

I respectfully request a payment plan structured as follows:

- December 2025 Rent: Payment in three installments over January, February, and March 2026
- January 2026 Rent: Payment in two installments during January and February 2026
- February 2026 and Forward: Return to full, on-time monthly rent payments

I am willing to provide documentation of my hardship, including utility bills showing payment difficulties, business formation documents demonstrating my active business operations, and proof of pending contract negotiations.

WHY THIS PLAN BENEFITS BOTH PARTIES

Granting this payment plan serves both of our interests. For your management company, it avoids the costs and delays associated with eviction proceedings, potential property vacancy, and the expense of finding new tenants. For me, it provides the breathing room necessary to secure the income streams that will allow me to become a reliable, long-term tenant who pays consistently going forward.

I have a Master's degree in Sport Management from Virginia State University, a strong professional background including federal employment with the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, and extensive corporate experience with organizations including Walmart, Disney, and Capital One. I am a published author and have built legitimate businesses over more than a decade. This current hardship is temporary and situational, not reflective of my character or long-term financial capability.

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

I am available to meet with management at your earliest convenience to discuss this request and sign a formal payment plan agreement. I can be reached by phone at (323) 545-8969 or by email at masterkingmalik@gmail.com. I am flexible and available to meet this week, including during the holiday period, to demonstrate my seriousness about resolving this matter.

I want to emphasize that I value my tenancy and the stability that this apartment provides. I am committed to working with you to find a solution that honors my obligations while allowing me to continue residing here as I work through this temporary financial challenge.

Thank you for your time, consideration, and understanding during this difficult period. I look forward to your response and the opportunity to work together on a mutually beneficial solution.

Respectfully,

Thurman Malik Robinson Jr.
CEO, APPS HOLDINGS WY, INC.
CFO, Assertively Promoting Philanthropic Services APPS, LLC
